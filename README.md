# Orion Nebula Project

A complete level pack with story line, custom music, and custom levels for Descent I and II.  Descent is an MS-DOS PC video game published by Interplay.  Myself and the ONP team completed this level pack in the late 1990's.  To my knowledge it's one of the first fan created complete 'DLC' like add-ons for a video game.  Full versions of the game are required to play.

When Descent II was released, the original Orion Nebula Project was refreshed and repacked to enjoy on the new game.
