# Orion Nebula Project

A complete game add-on with story line, custom music, and custom levels for Descent I and II.  Descent is an MS-DOS PC video game published by Interplay.  Myself and the ONP team completed this game add-on in the late 1990's.  To my knowledge, it's one of the first fan created complete 'DLC' like add-ons for a video game.  

When Descent II was released, the original Orion Nebula Project was refreshed and released as version 2.0 to enjoy on the second version of Descent.

Also a very big thanks to the numerous people who made this all possible,
including the makers and distributors of Descent, the people who made such
wonderful level design tools such as DEVIL, DMB, DesEdit, Descent Studio,
HAMM, Descent Manager and many others I forget to mention.
Thank you one and all!
