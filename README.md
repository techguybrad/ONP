# Orion Nebula Project

A complete game add-on with story line, custom music, and custom levels for Descent I and II.  Descent is an MS-DOS PC video game published by Interplay.  Myself and the ONP team completed this game add-on in the late 1990's.  To my knowledge, it's one of the first fan created complete 'DLC' like add-ons for a video game.  

When Descent II was released, the original Orion Nebula Project was refreshed and released as version 2.0 to enjoy on the second version of Descent.
