The Story
~~~~~~~~~
About 1,500 light years from Earth there is a Nebula. This Nebula is visible
from earth and is part of the Orion Constellation. The Orion Nebula has been
the site of a major mining operation especially since the discovery of Orium
a substance that is harder than diamond, is as light as aluminum, and yet
very heat resistant. Unfortunately only one planet has been found that
contains Orium, Alpha Pavonis. Orium is very valuable in fact the PTMC has
sold a lot of this Orium to Intergalactic Peace Organizations, and has also
used some of it to defend the Orion Nebula where Orium is found. There are
Defense outposts and other bases among the Orion Nebula. Each station is
powered by highly volatile fusion reactors that when set on detention destroy
the entire structure and its contents. Since the discovery of Orium many
other military and some Alien organizations have been trying to steal this
substance in order to replicate it or use it to take over the universe. In
most cases they have failed, until a month ago when the PTMC lost
communication will half a fleet of robots due to an unexpected
communications breach. After which these effected robots began to modify
themselves and the robots around them. Soon after all mining operations were
canceled by the rebellion of these robots. After several attempt to self
detonate the effected mine failed the robots escaped the mine and began to
infiltrate the entire Nebula with these modified rebel robots. Now all
communication has been severed from the Orion Nebula. The only known
solution is to destroy all traces of these robots meaning a manual
detonation of the stations' and mines' reactor. You have been elected to
lead the Orion Nebula Project. To take back what was lost. The very fate
of the universe may depend on your victory or failure. You are the best
pilot the PTMC has to offer, that is why you have been chosen. Now without
fail Prepare for another Descent...



What it's all about!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Thank you for trying the Orion Nebula Project (ONP).  ONP is a set of add-on
levels for Descent 2 Commercial Version 1.2 only.  It cannot be run on neither
the Interactive Demo nor the Destination Quartzon version. ONP is the result
of about 12 people working thousands of hours and producing the best quality
for your pleasure.  ONP contains seven, maybe eight (if you can find it)
levels with optional !NEW! MIDI music to listen to while you play and
!Briefings! I relate the storyline as it unfolds.  All this is provided free
of charge and is not intended for the purpose of profit.  But as always this
piece of software is provided AS-IS and there is no technical support
available.

NOTE: There is also a D1 version available!
Get it from http://www.descent2.com/orion !



Notes to the V2.01 revision:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It was at beginning of November '96, one month before the initial Descent
Manager version, where I downloaded the original Orion Nebula Project for
Descent 1. I was immediatly keen on the quality of this level set, mainly
because it is an allround-package: not just one or more levels, no, there is
a story, custom music, briefings and graphic; made by a team of real Descent
freaks! You instantly realise that the whole set was made with love to the
detail... And in the same moment I began to dream to be part of that team...

In February '97 Bradley released the Descent 2 version, but I was not that
enthusiastic anymore: The briefing logo was replaced with a new one that
absolutely was not my case, and -even worse- all songs by Benjamin Brewster
were just dropped... I missed the classic quality of the Descent 1 version,
that made it into the history of Descent; the new version just looked to me
as a quick conversion... I offered Brad to bring out a V2.01 version a few
days later with all musics, but it was not released...

Now it is one year after I first saw the D1 version! I have made a name in the
world of Descent Developers with such things as Descent Manager, Cool Tips
and the Descent Developer Network. I revised Entropy Experiment for Luke
Schneider and now am going back to the roots: The Orion Nebula Project!
I offered Brad to make a full revise of both the D1 and the D2 version with a
new homepage, new briefing design and -of course- all musics in the D2
version, giving back the breath of something very special: A classical Descent
level-set... After Brad has looked through my work on the V1.01 version of
Entropy he granted the permission for the revision...

Okay, now designing the 1.01/2.01 versions was not an easy task. Orion Nebula
Project is THE classic amateur level set, so you cannot just put in the
newest special effects. So the goal was to get the highest possible quality
out of the mission without destroying its orginality nor compatibility in
multiplayer game. I cannot just add custom polygon models, D2 robots or even
D2 weapons, just to make it competitive to Entropy Experiment or Phobos
Encounter! I had to be aware that Orion is a classic production and not an
uptodate production. Compare it to letting Pink Floyd completly re-record
"The Wall"... It just wouldn't be the same... But increasing the quality
in a special edition is possible...

But then I found a quite important bug in the original D2 version 2.0, to be
precisely in level 4... DEVIL had made some s***, assigning a hidden door as
an exit (additionally to the normal exit door)... So flying through it ended
the level instead of its real task: opening a locked door at the opposite...
I talked to Brad to let him decide what to do: let the bug or fix it making it
incompatible in multiplayer games with V2.0... He decided the second way and
so I fixed it... So unfortunately you won't be able to mix it with V2.0 in a
multiplayer game :(... you first have to let everybody in the game update to
V2.01 first... (by the way, V1.0 for D1 does not have this bug, so this does
not apply for the D1-version...)

And now it is finished and I think I was successful and accomplished my
goals... Of course I am open for critism, just decide yourself... But even
independant of this, something has been fulfilled: A dream has come true,
I was working in the ONP team... A great feeling... Thanks to Brad for giving
me this opportunity!!

What's new in the V2.01 version:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Fully revised and overworked briefings and its graphics.
- Corrected some misspellings.
- Moved credits to the end of the game.
- Included all D1-ONP-musics in D2-ONP.
- You only need to run a batch file for correct ONP L6 and L7 musics.
- Seperated FM-upgrade for OPL-Soundcards (Generally all cards without
  wavetable!).
- Now all files have to be copied into the same directory (instead of manually
  copying them to their correct dirs, which was quite unhandy...).
- Brought in some special effects (e.g. end-of-level screens).
- Fixed a bug in D2-version level 4, an incorrectly set "normal exit".
- Used new ONP logo.
- Updated the MN2 and TXT file informations (URLs, eMail-adress etc.).
- Full author informations in MNX and AUT formats and the mission report
  (*.REP) available.



Requirements:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1) Descent 2 Commercial is required. Destination Quartzon and the Interactive
   Demo are NOT supported.

2) Please make sure you have D2 Version 1.2 or higher running, otherwise
   textures may not show properly. You can update to V1.2 using the patch
   on http://www.descent2.com/patches !

3) For the ONP soundtrack you need a wavetable soundcard and CD music turned
   off (D2 Options dialog). If you are running the DOS version of Descent 2 you
   also need to run ORION-D2.BAT before starting D2, otherwise you won't hear
   the full soundtrack.



Installation:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1) Start the EXE file within the Descent 2 MISSIONS directory.

2) To enable the full soundtrack of ONP, please run ORION-D2.BAT first,
   before starting Descent 2. If you only have a FM card or running the Win95
   version of D2 you can skip this...

3) Run Descent and choose "Orion Nebula Project" from the levels selection
   menu. You are now playing the Orion Nebula Project.

4) To fully restore the original soundtrack after playing ONP simply run
   ORION-D2.BAT again.



ATTENTION FM-Sound card (OPL2/OPL3) users:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you don't have a wavetable soundcard, only a OPL2/OPL3 chip driven
FM-synthesizer, you won't hear the new soundtrack in this release.

But this mission has been prepared to have sound on such a soundcard, too.
You need the "FM-upgrade for Orion Nebula Project V1.01/V2.01" (which is the
same for both D1 and D2 version). Install it in the Descent directory, at any
time after or before you installed ONP V1.01 into it. Then run "ORION-FM.BAT"
to enable the custom soundtrack for FM cards (but on the same turn disabling
the level musics for all other missions :( ), and ORION-FM.BAT again to disable
it again and re-enable the normal soundtrack for all missions...

However you should take it as a temporary solution! We have made the best to
provide the best possible sound on these cards, but this is still *FAR* away
from a wavetable-soundcards! As these cards are not that expensive anymore, you
should really consider buying one. Probably the best ones are the TerraTec
soundcards, visit their homepage at http://www.terratec.net !

The FM-upgrade can be downloaded seperately at http://www.descent2.com/orion !

Also a very big thanks to the numerous people who made this all possible,
including the makers and distributors of Descent, the people who made such
wonderful level design tools such as DEVIL, DMB, DesEdit, Descent Studio,
HAMM, Descent Manager and many others I forget to mention.
Thank you one and all!
